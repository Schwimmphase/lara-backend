      "abstract": "The volume of scientific output is creating an urgent need for automated tools to help scientists keep up with developments in their field. Semantic Scholar (S2) is an open data platform and website aimed at accelerating science by helping scholars discover and understand scientific literature. We combine public and proprietary data sources using state-of-theart techniques for scholarly PDF content extraction and automatic knowledge graph construction to build the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph, the largest open scientific literature graph to-date, with 200M+ papers, 80M+ authors, 550M+ paper-authorship edges, and 2.4B+ citation edges. The graph includes advanced semantic features such as structurally parsed text, natural language summaries, and vector embeddings. In this paper, we describe the components of the S2 data processing pipeline and the associated APIs offered by the platform. We will update this living document to reflect changes as we add new data offerings and improve existing services.",

      "title": "Leveraging Knowledge Graph Embeddings to Disambiguate Author Names in Scientific Data",
      "abstract": "Access to scientific data is dependent on the proper indexing of such data for findability (alongside other FAIR standards) on portals, aggregators and more generally-speaking on the Web. Due to a lack of uptake in terms of standards (e.g., on unique identifiers, ORCID records, etc.), author name disambiguation continues to represent a major issue in organizing such research data. In this work, we present a novel approach to resolving name ambiguity for scientific authors as they appear in data about publications, grants or scientific datasets. Specifically, we leverage metadata present in a document in order to cluster similar authors: In addition to commonly-used information such as co-authorship, we include named entity similarities obtained from knowledge graphs as an additional source of information to further improve document representation and, subsequently, cluster the documents by authors. Due to the computational complexity of graph algorithms, we leverage knowledge graph embeddings to approximate the structure of large graphs. We evaluate our approach against an existing solution on a gold standard dataset and show that our approach provides notable improvement, especially when other information is sparse. In addition, we provide a novel, manually-annotated dataset for this task, consisting of scientific publications and project data.",

      "title": "SumMER: Structural Summarization for RDF/S KGs",
      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs are becoming more and more prevalent on the web, ranging from small taxonomies, to large knowledge bases containing a vast amount of information. To construct such knowledge graphs either automatically or manually, tools are necessary for their quick exploration and understanding. Semantic summaries have been proposed as a key technology enabling the quick understanding and exploration of large knowledge graphs. Among the methods proposed for generating summaries, structural methods exploit primarily the structure of the graph in order to generate the result summaries. Approaches in the area focus on identifying the most important nodes and usually employ a single centrality measure, capturing a specific perspective on the notion of a node’s importance. Moving from one centrality measure to many however, has the potential to generate a more objective view on nodes’ importance, leading to better summaries. In this paper, we present SumMER, the first structural summarization technique exploiting machine learning techniques for RDF/S KGs. SumMER explores eight centrality measures and then exploits machine learning techniques for optimally selecting the most important nodes. Then those nodes are linked formulating a subgraph out of the original graph. We experimentally show that combining centrality measures with machine learning effectively increases the quality of the generated summaries.",

      "abstract": "Graph entity dependencies (GEDs) are novel graph constraints, unifying keys and functional dependencies, for property graphs. They have been found useful in many real-world data quality and data management tasks, including fact checking on social media networks and entity resolution. In this paper, we study the discovery problem of GEDs – ﬁnding a minimal cover of valid GEDs in a given graph data. We formalise the problem, and propose an eﬀective and eﬃcient approach to overcome major bottlenecks in GED discovery. In particular, we leverage existing graph partitioning algorithms to enable fast GED-scope discovery, and employ eﬀective pruning strategies over the prohibitively large space of candidate dependencies. Furthermore, we deﬁne an interestingness measure for GEDs based on the minimum description",

      "abstract": "A knowledge base, expressed using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), can be viewed as a graph whose nodes represent entities and whose edges denote relationships. The entity relatedness problem refers to the problem of discovering and understanding how two entities are related, directly or indirectly, that is, how they are connected by paths in a knowledge base. Strategies designed to solve the entity relatedness problem typically adopt an entity similarity measure to reduce the path search space and a path ranking measure to order and filter the list of paths returned. This article presents a framework, called CoEPinKB, that supports the empirical evaluation of such strategies. The proposed framework allows combining entity similarity and path ranking measures to generate different path search strategies. The main goals of this article are to describe the framework and present a performance evaluation of nine different path search strategies.",

The procedure of name disambiguation is to divide publications with the same name into different groups, each group belonging to a unique author. A large amount of attribute information in publications makes traditional methods fall into the quagmire of feature selection. These methods always select attributes artiﬁcially and equally, which usually causes a negative impact on accuracy. The proposed method is mainly based on representation learning for heterogeneous networks and clustering and exploits the self-attention technology to solve the problem. The presentation of publications is a synthesis of structural and semantic representations. The structural representation is obtained by meta-path- based sampling and a skip-gram-based embedding method, and meta-path level attention is introduced to automatically learn the weight of each feature. The semantic representation is generated using NLP tools. Our proposal performs better in terms of name disambiguation accuracy compared with baselines and the ablation experiments demonstrate the improvement by feature selection and the meta-path level attention in our method. The experimental results show the superiority of our new method for capturing the most attributes from publications and reducing the impact of redundant information.",

      "abstract": "Bridging unstructured data with knowledge bases is an essential task in many problems related to natural language understanding. Traditionally, this task is considered in one direction only: linking entity mentions in a text to their counterpart in a knowledge base (also known as entity linking). In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem from a different angle: linking entities from a knowledge base to paragraphs describing those entities. We argue that such a new perspective can be beneficial to several applications, including information retrieval, knowledge base population, and joint entity and word embedding. We present a transformer-based model, ParaGraph, which, given a Wikidata entity as input, retrieves its corresponding Wikipedia section. To perform this task, ParaGraph first generates an entity summary and compares it to sections to select an initial set of candidates. The candidates are then ranked using additional information from the entity’s textual description and contextual information. Our experimental results show that ParaGraph achieves 87% Hits@10 when ranking Wikipedia sections given a Wikidata entity as input. The obtained results show that ParaGraph can reduce the information gap between Wikipedia-based entities and tail entities and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach towards linking knowledge graph entities to their text counterparts.",

      "abstract": "Background: Knowledge graphs and ontologies are becoming increasingly important as technical solutions for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data and metadata (FAIR Guiding Principles). We discuss four challenges that impede the use of FAIR knowledge graphs. Results: Semantic units have the potential to solve the challenges by structuring a knowledge graph into identifiable and semantically meaningful subgraphs. Each semantic unit is represented by its own resource, instantiates a corresponding semantic unit class, and can be implemented as a FAIR Digital Object and a nanopublication in RDF/OWL and property graphs. We distinguish statement and compound units as basic categories of semantic units. Statement units represent smallest, independent propositions that are semantically meaningful for a human reader. They consist of one or more triples and mathematically partition a knowledge graph. We distinguish assertional, contingent (prototypical), and universal statement units as basic types of statement units and propose representational schemes and formal semantics for them (including for absence statements, negations, and cardinality restrictions) that do not involve blank nodes and that translate back to OWL. Compound units, on the other hand, represent semantically meaningful collections of semantic units and we distinguish various types of compound units, representing different levels of representational granularity, different types of granularity trees, and different frames of reference. Conclusions: Semantic units support making statements about statements, can be used for graphalignment, subgraph-matching, knowledge graph profiling, and for managing access restrictions to sensitive data. Organizing the graph into semantic units supports the separation of ontological, diagnostic (i.e., referential), and discursive information, and it also supports the differentiation of multiple frames of reference.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KG) have become a widespread knowledge representation. When different KGs exist for some domain, it is valuable to merge them into a richer KG. This is known as the problem of KG alignement, which encompasses related problems such as entity alignement or ontology matching. Although most recent approaches rely on supervised representation learning, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) has also been proposed as a basis for symbolic and unsupervised approaches. We here explore the application of Graph-FCA, an extension of FCA for KGs, to different scenarios of KG alignments: (A) when the two KGs have common values, and (B) when pre-aligned pairs are known. We show that, compared to previous FCA-based approaches, Graph-FCA allows for a more natural and scalable representation of the KGs to be aligned, and makes it simpler to extract alignments from the concepts. It also features flexibility w.r.t. different alignment scenarios.",

      "abstract": "With an exponentially growing number of graphs from disparate repositories, there is a strong need to analyze a graph database containing an extensive collection of small- or medium-sized data graphs ( e.g., chemical compounds). Although subgraph enumeration and subgraph mining have been proposed to bring insights into a graph database by a set of subgraph structures, they often end up with similar or homogenous topologies, which is undesirable in many graph applications. To address this limitation, we propose the Top-k Edge-Diversified Patterns Discovery problem to retrieve a set of subgraphs that cover the maximum number of edges in a database. To efficiently process such query, we present a generic and extensible framework called Ted which achieves a guaranteed approximation ratio to the optimal result. Two optimization strategies are further developed to improve the performance. Experimental studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Ted to traditional techniques.",

We then leverage modern graph learning techniques to turn this graph into a highly efficient tool for dimensionality reduction. Documents are represented as low-dimensional vector embeddings generated with a graph autoencoder. Our experiments show that this approach outperforms traditional document vector-based and text autoencoding approaches on labeled data. Additionally, we have applied this technique to a repository of unlabeled research documents about the novel coronavirus to demonstrate its effectiveness as a real-world tool.",

The KGE finds appropriate representations of entities and relations by learning structured information in triples and uses these representations to predict the missing links in a knowledge graph (KG). The entity types are included in many KGs, but most of the existing methods ignored its potential for the link prediction task. The proposed framework, which is called EETCRL (Entity and Entity Type Composition Representation Learning), learns representations for entities and entity types in a simple way. Those combined representations are used for link prediction. The proposed framework is evaluated on three datasets and the results show that while the overall performance was comparable to baseline methods, its performance depends on the entity type. This paper also discusses how the information about entity types affects the link prediction through analysis of the fine-grained results.",

      "abstract": "The knowledge graph is an effective tool for improving natural language processing, but manually annotating enormous amounts of knowledge is expensive. Academics have conducted research on entity and relation extraction techniques, among which, the end-to-end table-filling approach is a popular direction for achieving joint entity and relation extraction. However, once the table has been populated in a uniform label space, a large number of null labels are generated within the array, causing label-imbalance problems, which could result in a tendency of the model’s encoder to predict null labels; that is, model generalization performance decreases. In this paper, we propose a method to mitigate non-essential null labels in matrices. This method utilizes a score matrix to calculate the count of non-entities and the percentage of non-essential null labels in the matrix, which is then projected by the power of natural constant to generate an entity-factor matrix. This is then incorporated into the scoring matrix. In the back-propagation process, the gradient of non-essential null-labeled cells in the entity factor layer is affected and shrinks, the amplitude of which is related to the size of the entity factor, thereby reducing the feature learning of the model for a large number of non-essential null labels. Experiments with two publicly available benchmark datasets show that the incorporation of entity factors significantly improved model performance, especially in the relation extraction task, by 1.5% in both cases.",

      "abstract": "How to extract high-value knowledge quickly, accurately and comprehensively from high volume, and high variety data in vertical field, is a major issue to be solved in the intelligent construction of various fields. Knowledge extraction, which extracts large-scale structured knowledge from multi-source heterogeneous data, can provide a strong support for many applications, such as knowledge graph construction, automatic question answering, situation awareness and intelligent decision. In this paper, we first summarize the critic problems and challenges of knowledge extraction in vertical field by surveying the key technologies involved in knowledge extraction. Then, we propose a unified framework of knowledge extraction targeting for vertical field. This framework presents a detail solution for the key problems in knowledge extraction and indicates the potential research work to be carried out in the future.",

      "abstract": "There are several Knowledge Graphs expressed in RDF (Resource Description Framework) that aggregate/integrate data from various sources for providing unified access services and enabling insightful analytics. We observe this trend in almost every domain of our life. However, the provision of effective, efficient, and user-friendly analytic services and systems is quite challenging. In this paper we survey the approaches, systems and tools that enable the formulation of analytic queries over KGs expressed in RDF. We identify the main challenges, we distinguish two main categories of analytic queries (domain specific and quality-related), and five kinds of approaches for analytics over RDF. Then, we describe in brief the works of each category and related aspects, like efficiency and visualization. We hope this collection to be useful for researchers and engineers for advancing the capabilities and user-friendliness of methods for analytics over knowledge graphs.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we use sentence similarity as a lens through which to investigate the representation of meaning in graphs vs. vectors. On semantic textual similarity data, we examine how similarity metrics based on vectors alone (SENTENCE-BERT and BERTSCORE) fare compared to metrics based on AMR graphs (SMATCH and S2MATCH). Quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the AMR-based metrics can better capture meanings dependent on sentence structures, but can also be distracted by structural differences—whereas the BERT-based metrics represent finer-grained meanings of individual words, but often fail to capture the ordering effect of words within sentences and suffer from interpretability problems. These findings contribute to our understanding of each approach to semantic representation and motivate distinct use cases for graph and vector-based representations.",

      "abstract": "The explosive growth of RDF data makes it difficult to be efficiently queried, understood and used. RDF graph (RDFG) summarization aims to extract the most relevant and crucial data as summaries according to different criteria. Current summarization approaches mainly apply single strategies such as graph structure, pattern mining or relevance metrics to calculate RDFG summaries. Different to the existing approaches, this paper proposes a summarization approach to automatically generating RDFG summary, which can capture both structure and centrality information. Specifically, we present three algorithms, SumW (merging nodes based on node characteristics or similar types), SumS (merging nodes based on typed node characteristics) and SummaryFL (retrieving central nodes by combining node frequency and bridging coefficient). The three algorithms can be used by two summarization strategies: SumS or SumW only, and SumS+SummaryFL or SumW+SummaryFL. We conducted experiments over large and real-world RDF datasets to verify the effectiveness of our method with respect to time complexity, compression capability and coverage of the summary. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperformed the comparative algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured databases that capture real-world entities and their relationships. The task of entity retrieval from a KG aims at retrieving a ranked list of entities relevant to a given user query. While English-only entity retrieval has attracted considerable attention, user queries, as well as the information contained in the KG, may be represented in multiple—and possibly distinct—languages. Furthermore, KG content may vary between languages due to different information sources and points of view. Recent advances in language representation have enabled natural ways of bridging gaps between languages. In this paper, we therefore propose to utilise language models (LMs) and diverse entity representations to enable truly multilingual entity retrieval. We propose two approaches: (i) an array of monolingual retrievers and (ii) a single multilingual retriever, trained using queries and documents in multiple languages. We show that while our approach is on par with the significantly more complex state-of-the-art method for the English task, it can be successfully applied to virtually any language with a LM. Furthermore, it allows languages to benefit from one another, yielding significantly better performance, both for low- and high-resource languages.",

      "abstract": "Building and publishing knowledge graphs (KG) as Linked Data, either on the Web or in private companies, has become a relevant and crucial process in many domains. This process requires that users perform a wide number of tasks conforming to the life cycle of a KG, and these tasks usually involve different unrelated research topics, such as RDF materialisation or link discovery. There is already a large corpus of tools and methods designed to perform these tasks; however, the lack of one tool that gathers them all leads practitioners to develop ad-hoc pipelines that are not generic and, thus, non-reusable. As a result, building and publishing a KG is becoming a complex and resource-consuming process. In this paper, a generic framework called Helio is presented. The framework aims to cover a set of requirements elicited from the KG life cycle and provide a tool capable of performing the different tasks required to build and publish KGs. As a result, Helio aims at providing users with the means for reducing the effort required to perform this process and, also, Helio aims to prevent the development of ad-hoc pipelines. Furthermore, the Helio framework has been applied in many different contexts, from European projects to research work.",

We address two challenge in entity linking: how to leverage wider contexts surrounding a mention, and how to deal with limited training data. We propose a fully unsupervised model called SumMC that first generates a guided summary of the contexts conditioning on the mention, and then casts the task to a multiple-choice problem where the model chooses an entity from a list of candidates. In addition to evaluating our model on existing datasets that focus on named entities, we create a new dataset that links noun phrases from WikiHow to Wikidata. We show that our SumMC model achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised performance on our new dataset and on exiting datasets.",

      "abstract": "—In the past few decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available data produced from various sources with different topics. The availability of this enormous data necessitates us to adopt effective computational tools to explore the data. This leads to an intense growing interest in the research community to develop computational methods focused on processing this text data. A line of study focused on condensing the text so that we are able to get a higher level of understanding in a shorter time. The two important tasks to do this are keyword extraction and text summarization. In keyword extraction, we are interested in ﬁnding the key important words from a text. This makes us familiar with the general topic of a text. In text summarization, we are interested in producing a short-length text which includes important information about the document. The TextRank algorithm, an unsupervised learning method that is an extension of the PageRank (algorithm which is the base algorithm of Google search engine for searching pages and ranking them) has shown its efﬁcacy in large-scale text mining, especially for text summarization and keyword extraction. this algorithm can automatically extract the important parts of a text (keywords or sentences) and declare them as the result. However, this algorithm neglects the semantic similarity between the different parts. In this work, we improved the results of the TextRank algorithm by incorporating the semantic similarity between parts of the text. Aside from keyword extraction and text summarization, we develop a topic clustering algorithm based on our framework which can be used individually or as a part of generating the summary to overcome coverage problems.",

In this paper, we target the discovery of tagged unions, a JSON Schema design pattern where the value of one property of an object (the tag) conditionally implies subschemas for sibling properties. We formalize these implications as conditional functional dependencies and capture them using the JSON Schema operators if-then-else. We further motivate our heuristics to avoid overfitting. Experiments with our prototype implementation are promising, and show that this form of tagged unions can successfully be detected in real-world GeoJSON and TopoJSON datasets. In discussing future work, we outline how our approach can be extended further.",

      "abstract": "—Through the growth of portals and venues to publish academic publications, the number of academic publications is growing exponentially in recent years. An effective exploration and fast navigation in the collection of academic publications become an urgent need to help academic researchers find publications related to their research and the surrounding community. A scholar network visualization approach is proposed to help users to explore a large number of academic publications concerning the strength of the relationship between each publication. The approach is realized by creating a web-based interface using D3 JavaScript algorithm that allows the visualization to focus on how data are connected to each other more accurately than the conventional lines of data seen in traditional data representation. The proposed approach visualizes data by incorporating a force-directed graph with weighted nodes and vertices to give more descriptive information of millions of raw data such as author names, publication title, publication year, publication venue and number of citations from the scholar network dataset. By introducing a weighted relationship in the network visualization, the proposed approach can give a more insightful detail of each publication such as a highly cited publication by looking at and exploring the generated interactive graph. The proposal is targeted to be incorporated into a larger-scale scholar network analytical dashboard that can offer various visualization approaches under one flagship application.",

Any downstream task performed by these models implicitly builds on these facts, and thus it is highly desirable to have means for representing this body of knowledge in an interpretable way. However, there is currently no mechanism for such a representation. Here, we propose to address this goal by extracting a knowledge-graph of facts from a given language model. We describe a procedure for “crawling” the internal knowledge-base of a language model. Speciﬁcally, given a seed entity, we expand a knowledge-graph around it. The crawling procedure is decomposed into sub-tasks, realized through specially designed prompts that control for both precision (i.e., that no wrong facts are generated) and recall (i.e., the number of facts generated). We eval-uate our approach on graphs crawled starting from dozens of seed entities, and show it yields high precision graphs (82-92%), while emit-ting a reasonable number of facts per entity.",

      "abstract": ": We address the challenge of building domain-specific knowledge models for industrial use cases, where labelled data and taxonomic information is initially scarce. Our focus is on inductive link prediction models as a basis for practical tools that support knowledge engineers with exploring text collections and discovering and linking new (so-called open-world) entities to the knowledge graph. We argue that – though neural approaches to text mining have yielded impressive results in the past years – current benchmarks do not reflect the typical challenges encountered in the industrial wild properly. Therefore, our first contribution is an open benchmark coined IRT2 (inductive reasoning with text) that (1) covers knowledge graphs of varying sizes (including very small ones), (2) comes with incidental, low-quality text mentions, and (3) includes not only triple completion but also ranking, which is relevant for supporting experts with discovery tasks. We investigate two neural models for inductive link prediction, one based on end-to-end learning and one that learns from the knowledge graph and text data in separate steps. These models compete with a strong bag-of-words baseline. The results show a significant advance in performance for the neural approaches as soon as the available graph data decreases for linking. For ranking, the results are promising, and the neural approaches outperform the sparse retriever by a wide margin.",

      "abstract": "In this article, Vogt places his research in the context of big data and he argues the interest of ontologies to represent data and to satisfy the criteria of machine usability (i.e. eScience-compliant) and therefore f indable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). But this is not the main interest of the article. The article is extremely complete, recalling all the concepts necessary to understand it and unfolding very precise examples of biological phenotype (insects with their heads and antennas). Vogt then develops a long discussion on the different approaches to knowledge modelling, on the computability of each of the chosen representation modes, on the interest of metadata, on the questions raised by the Open World Assumption and on the use of reasoners. A long part of the article compares the two approaches: the TBox semantic graph approach based on classes, called Semantic Phenotype, and the ABox semantic graph approach based on instances, called Phenotype Knowledge Graph. He concludes that, from a conceptual point of view, the advantages of the instance-based ABox semantic graph approach outweigh its shortcomings and outweigh the advantages of the class-based TBox semantic graph approach. Therefore, he recommends the instance-based ABox approach as a FAIR approach for documenting and communicating empirical data and metadata in a knowledge graph. Further to this conclusion, this article specifies descriptions and arguments for both types of representation and, in passing, specifies the interest of semantic representations in general and their computability difficulty. It is a thought-provoking article.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) predicts missing facts in an incomplete Knowledge Graph (KG). Multilingual KGs associate entities and relations with surface forms written in different languages. An entity or relation may be associated with distinct IDs in different KGs, necessitating entity alignment (EA) and relation alignment (RA). Many effective algorithms have been proposed for completion and alignment as separate tasks. Here we show that these tasks are synergistic and best solved together. Our multitask approach starts with a state-of-the-art KG embedding scheme, but adds a novel relation representation based on sets of embeddings of (subject, object) entity pairs. This representation leads to a new relation alignment loss term based on a maximal bipartite matching between two sets of embedding vectors. This loss is combined with traditional KGC loss and optionally, losses based on text embeddings of entity (and relation) names. In experiments over KGs in seven languages, we find that our system achieves large improvements in KGC compared to a strong completion model that combines known facts in all languages. It also outperforms strong EA and RA baselines, underscoring the value of joint alignment and completion.",

      "abstract": "In a citation graph, adjacent paper nodes share related scientiﬁc terms and topics. The graph thus conveys unique structure information of document-level relatedness that can be utilized in the paper summarization task, for explor-ing beyond the intra-document information. In this work, we focus on leveraging citation graphs to improve scientiﬁc paper extractive summarization under different settings. We ﬁrst propose a Multi-granularity Unsupervised Summarization model (MUS) as a simple and low-cost solution to the task. MUS ﬁnetunes a pre-trained encoder model on the citation graph by link prediction tasks. Then, the abstract sentences are extracted from the corresponding paper considering multi-granularity information. Preliminary results demonstrate that citation graph is helpful even in a simple unsupervised framework. Motivated by this, we next propose a Graph-based Supervised Summarization model (GSS) to achieve more accurate results on the task when large-scale labeled data are available. Apart from employing the link prediction as an auxiliary task, GSS introduces a gated sentence encoder and a graph information fusion module to take advantage of the graph information to polish the sentence representation. Experiments on a public benchmark dataset show that MUS and GSS bring substantial improvements over the prior state-of-the-art model.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to recent advancements in machine learning, vector-based methods have been adopted in many modern information retrieval (IR) systems. While showing promising retrieval performance, these approaches typically fail to explain why a particular document is retrieved as a query result to address explainable information retrieval (XIR). Knowledge graphs record structured information about entities and inherently explainable relationships. Most of existing XIR approaches focus exclusively on the retrieval model with little consideration on using existing knowledge graphs for providing an explanation. In this paper, we propose a general architecture to incorporate knowledge graphs for XIR in various steps of the retrieval process. Furthermore, we create two instances of the architecture for different types of explanation. We evaluate our approaches on well-known IR benchmarks using standard metrics and compare them with vector-based methods as baselines.",

      "title": "Pylon: Semantic Table Union Search in Data Lakes",
      "abstract": "—The large size and fast growth of data repositories, such as data lakes, has spurred the need for data discovery to help analysts ﬁnd related data. The problem has become challenging as (i) a user typically does not know what datasets exist in an enormous data repository; and (ii) there is usually a lack of a uniﬁed data model to capture the interrelationships between heterogeneous datasets from disparate sources. In this work, we address one important class of discovery needs: ﬁnding union-able tables. The task is to ﬁnd tables in a data lake that can be unioned with a given query table. The challenge is to recognize union- able columns even if they are represented differently. In this paper, we propose a data-driven learning approach: speciﬁcally, an unsupervised representation learning and embedding retrieval task. Our key idea is to exploit self-supervised contrastive learning to learn an embedding model that takes into account the indexing/search data structure and produces embeddings close by for columns with semantically similar values while pushing apart columns with semantically dissimilar values. We then ﬁnd union-able tables based on similarities between their constituent columns in embedding space. On a real-world data lake, we demonstrate that our best-performing model achieves signiﬁcant improvements in precision ( 16% ↑ ), recall ( 17% ↑ ), and query response time (7x faster) compared to the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge‐enhanced short‐text matching has been a significant task attracting much attention in recent years. However, the existing approaches cannot effectively balance effect and efficiency. Effective models usually consist of complex network structures leading to slow inference speed and the difficulties of applications in actual practice. In addition, most knowledge‐enhanced models try to link the mentions in the text to the entities of the knowledge graphs—the difficulties of entity linking decrease the generalizability among different datasets. To address these problems, we propose a lightweight Semantic‐Enhanced Interactive Network (SEIN) model for efficient short‐text matching. Unlike most current research, SEIN employs an unsupervised method to select WordNet's most appropriate paraphrase description as the external semantic knowledge. It focuses on integrating semantic information and interactive information of text while simplifying the structure of other modules. We conduct intensive experiments on four real‐world datasets, that is, Quora, Twitter‐URL, SciTail, and SICK‐E. Compared with state‐of‐the‐art methods, SEIN achieves the best performance on most datasets. The experimental results proved that introducing external knowledge could effectively improve the performance of the short‐text matching models. The research sheds light on the role of lightweight models in leveraging external knowledge to improve the effect of short‐text matching.",

      "abstract": "Textual documents are growing rapidly through the internet in today’s modern technology era. Electronic structured databases archive offline and online documents, e-mails, webpages, blog and social network posts. Without appropriate ranking and demand clustering when there is classification without any specifics, it is quite difficult to retain and access these documents. K-means is one of the methods that is frequently used for clustering. In terms of determining the proximity of meaning or semantics between data, the distance-based K-means method still has flaws. To get around this issue, semantic similarity can be estimated by measuring the level of similarity between objects in a cluster. This research provides a method for clustering documents based on semantic similarity. The approach is carried out by defining document synopses from the IMDB and Wikipedia databases using the NLTK dictionary, and we provide a semantic-based K-means clustering approach that assesses not only the similarity of the data represented as a vector space model with TFIDF, but also the semantic similarity of the data Precision, recall, and F-measure, we demonstrate how well the semantic-based K-means clustering technique works using experimental findings from the IMDB and Wikipedia  top 100 movies datasets. \n ",
