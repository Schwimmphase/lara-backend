Lexical composition can shift the meanings of the constituent words and introduce implicit information. We tested a broad range of textual representations for their capacity to address these issues. We found that, as expected, contextualized word representations perform better than static word embeddings, more so on detecting meaning shift than in recovering implicit information, in which their performance is still far from that of humans. Our evaluation suite, consisting of six tasks related to lexical composition effects, can serve future research aiming to improve representations.\",\"title\":\"Still a Pain in the Neck: Evaluating Text Representations on Lexical Composition\",\"paperId\":\"a5ec883e080d858b5df60f1b5d711d514459b1e4\",\"url\":\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a5ec883e080d858b5df60f1b5d711d514459b1e4\",\"authors\":[{\"name\":\"Vered Shwartz\",\"authorId\":\"3103343\"},{\"name\":\"Ido Dagan\",\"authorId\":\"7465342\"}]}},{\"citingPaper\":{\"citationCount\":39,\"venue\":\"\",\"year\":2018,\"referenceCount\":83,\"abstract\":\"Agata Savary1, Marie Candito2, Verginica BarbuMititelu3, Eduard Bejček4, Fabienne Cap5, Slavomír Čéplö6, Silvio Ricardo Cordeiro7, Gülşen Eryiğit8, Voula Giouli9, Maarten van Gompel10, Yaakov HaCohen-Kerner11, Jolanta Kovalevskaitė12, SimonKrek13, Chaya Liebeskind11, JohannaMonti14, Carla Parra Escartín15, Lonneke van der Plas6, Behrang QasemiZadeh16, Carlos Ramisch7, Federico Sangati17, Ivelina Stoyanova18 & Veronika Vincze19 1Université de Tours (France), 2Université Paris Diderot (France), 3Romanian Academy Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Romania), 4Charles University (Czech Republic), 5Uppsala University (Sweden), 6University of Malta (Malta), 7Aix Marseille University (France), 8Istanbul Technical University (Turkey), 9Athena Research Center in Athens (Greece), 10Radboud University in Nijmegen (Netherlands), 11Jerusalem College of Technology (Israel), 12Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas (Lithuania), 13Jožef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana (Slovenia), 14\\u201cL\\u2019Orientale\\u201d University of Naples (Italy), 15ADAPT Centre, Dublin City University (Ireland), 16University of Düsseldorf (Germany), 17independent researcher (Italy), 18Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in Sofia (Bulgaria), 19Univer-\",\"title\":\"PARSEME multilingual corpus of verbal multiword expressions\",\"paperId\":\"9b48cbcaac4871a8264f9735ba323fe44c682951\",\"url\":\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9b48cbcaac4871a8264f9735ba323fe44c682951\",\"authors\":[{\"name\":\"J.

This paper presents an unsupervised approach for extracting templates on-the-fly from only tagged text by using a novel relaxed variant of the Sequence Binary Decision Diagram (SeqBDD). A SeqBDD can compress a set of sequences into a graphical structure equivalent to a minimal deterministic finite state automata, but more compact and better suited to the task of template extraction. The main contribution of this paper is a relaxed form of the SeqBDD construction algorithm that enables it to form general representations from a small amount of data. The process of compression of shared structures in the text during Relaxed SeqBDD construction, naturally induces the templates we wish to extract. Experiments show that the method is capable of high-quality extraction on tasks based on verb+preposition templates from corpora and phrasal templates from short messages from social media.\",\"title\":\"Extraction of templates from phrases using Sequence Binary Decision Diagrams\",\"paperId\":\"46db27d65bca54619d5783acba9161a2d8c49efa\",\"url\":\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46db27d65bca54619d5783acba9161a2d8c49efa\",\"authors\":[{\"name\":\"D.

Given an undirected, weighted graph, the minimum spanning tree (MST) is a tree that connects all of the vertices of the graph with minimum sum of edge weights. In real world applications, network designers often seek to quickly find a replacement edge for each edge in the MST. For example, when a traffic accident closes a road in a transportation network, or a line goes down in a communication network, the replacement edge may reconnect the MST at lowest cost. In the paper, we consider the case of finding the lowest cost replacement edge for each edge of the MST. A previous algorithm by Tarjan takes O( m\\u03b1 ( m, n )) time and space, where \\u03b1 ( m, n ) is the inverse Ackermann\\u2019s function. Given the MST and sorted non-tree edges, our algorithm is the first practical algorithm that runs in O( m + n ) time and O( m + n ) space to find all replacement edges. Additionally, since the most vital edge is the tree edge whose removal causes the highest cost, our algorithm finds it in linear time.\", \"venue\": \"\", \"year\": 2022, \"referenceCount\": 22, \"citationCount\": 0, \"authors\": [{\"authorId\": \"153595774\", \"name\": \"D.

The canonical parallel biconnectivity algorithm is the Tarjan-Vishkin algorithm, which hasO (n +m) optimal work (number of operations) and polylogarithmic span (longest dependent operations) on a graph with n vertices andm edges. However, Tarjan-Vishkin is not widely used in practice. We believe the reason is the space-inefficiency (it generates an auxiliary graph with O (m) edges). In practice, existing parallel implementations are based on breath-first search (BFS). Since BFS has span proportional to the diameter of the graph, existing parallel BCC implementations suffer from poor performance on large-diameter graphs and can be even slower than the sequential algorithm on many real-world graphs. We propose the first parallel biconnectivity algorithm (FAST-BCC) that has optimal work, polylogarithmic span, and is space-efficient. Our algorithm first generates a skeleton graph based on any spanning tree of the input graph. Then we use the connectivity information of the skeleton to compute the biconnectivity of the original input. All the steps in our algorithm are highly-parallel. We carefully analyze the correctness of our algorithm, which is highly non-trivial. We implemented FAST-BCC and compared it with existing implementations, including GBBS, Slota and Madduri\\u2019s algorithm, and the sequential Hopcroft-Tarjan algorithm. We ran them on a 96-core machine on 27 graphs, including social, web, road, k-NN, and synthetic graphs, with significantly varying sizes and edge distributions. FAST-BCC is the fastest on all 27 graphs. On average (geometric means), FAST-BCC is 5.1\\u00d7 faster than GBBS, and 3.1\\u00d7 faster than the best existing baseline on each graph.

It also generalizes the so-called F -tree recognition problem which has just been studied in the literature recently.
